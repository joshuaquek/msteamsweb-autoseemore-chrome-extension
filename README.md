# 📖 Auto "See More" for MS Teams
This simple Google Chrome extension for Microsoft Teams Web came about after realising that its quite tedious to be constantly expanding the "See More" and "replies from" button on each individual message on Microsoft Teams Web.

## 🤔Rationale
It has been a requested feature on MSTeams UserVoice feedback forums since 2018: https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/31984465-see-all-contents-without-having-to-click-see-more

...and also on other relevant threads:
* https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/31544650-disabling-see-more
* https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/35432848-see-more-option-needs-toggle-on-off
* https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/38472562-see-more-always-expand-conversations

Since no native fix has been implemented within Teams Web to resolve this, this extension aims to resolve that.

## 🐞Known Bugs
* ~~Native edit message feature is affected, due to the live clicks that are firing at a fixed interval.~~

In lieu of a formal style guide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Currently, we are using StandardJS for maintaining the coding style.
